What I Tell My Friends (with kids, who aren't "math people" if they ask about math)

I call this: The Easy to Do-Set for Life Playbook:

- Count everything and anything, eventually have them put things they count into groups and count the groups
- Play a <a href="https://x.com/m_pettyjohn/status/1209896950990069770">modified</a> circles and <a href="https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/mathematics/mathematics-curriculum-resources-k-12/thinking-mathematically-resources/mathematics-s1-circles-and-stars">stars</a> to help with this
- Have hundreds charts and reference them when they're counting
- Show them how they can skip count by 10s on the hundreds chart
- Make a "<a href="https://www.holliegriffith.com/monster-math-function-machine/">Function Machine</a>" and play
- Counting, place value, multiplicative reasoning, early algebraic thinking
- Keep it concrete, get reps, they'll be set
- Benefits for you: no future math fights over homework
- Benefits for them: a foundation to learn math to the highest level they will want 

If you are a "math person" reading this, yeah, there are a million other things you can do. 

Most of my friends are not "math people" but now their kids are.
