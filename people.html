		<h1>People</h1>
		<h3> "One thing you learn when you study strategy long enough, people really matter." - Hamilton Helmer</h3>



		Spent the past decade understanding the psychology, sociology of people and groups. Putting that knowledge to use turning around orgs and growing others. Also learning how to get to truth within an org, of how people think, how they act, and build an org to support all of this.

		Expectations
		- Can't or won't

		Fairness

		Safety, belonging, significance, satisfaction

		Hygiene factors


		One of the reasons I dislike the standard PERF system is it decreases hygiene, most recognize it as subjectivity masquerading as objectivity, which makes it feel unfair, creates discord among teams and can pit individuals against one another.
		The entire purpose of management is to amplify individual's strengths, and collectively make their weaknesses irrelevant. In other words, to create a team. PERF actively works against that.
		In other words, it's a heavyweight system that takes lots of time, resources, causes dissatisfaction, and makes the org worse.
		[Find the "what if I told you..."]

		Why are OKR's and PERF gamed wildly in one company but more effective in another? Culture and incentives.
		I know how to create the company culture that amplifies these tools, instead of turns them into games.

		OKRs and KPIs + Ethnography + Interviews can get you to the or close to the truth

		WHAT I LEARNED:
- What not to do. So many organizations were so poorly managed that I filed away countless ways to screw a business up. Years later I would come across Charlie Munger and find he has a name for this--inversion.
- Dysfunction at organizations is regular.
- The power of product/market fit. I wouldn't have called it that at the time, but I saw how some businesses could do almost everything wrong and still succeed.
- The human side of things. People matter. Listen to them. Learn from them and you can stitch together a pretty accurate picture of what is going on within an organization and in doing so, you'll have built relationships and trust with them to enact changes that may need to be made.



		<p> Distilled to its core, strategy is two questions:</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li> What's the right thing to do?</li>
			<li> What's the right way to do it?</li>
		</ol>
		<p> That's as abstract as it gets so here are six strategy influences and my synopsis of their core ideas:</p>
		<h3> Drucker</h3>
		<p> Opportunities are what make your business. Your strategy will probably fail because you don't see the opportunity in problems, you aren't building from strengths, you're chasing opportunities that are additive or complementary not breakthrough and your org probably doesn't have the ability to adapt to exploit breakthrough opportunities anyways.</p>
		<h3> Porter</h3>
		<p> Be in a good market, be a cost leader, or have a top brand.</p>
		<h3> Helmer</h3>
		<p> Executing a strategy is all about seeing in systems (internal to your org and external). When you start a business, finding out if you have Power is a discovery process. It takes seeing in systems to be able to run that discovery process and exploit Power when found.</p>
		<h3> Rumelt</h3>
		<p> Understand the challenge in front of you and respond coherently.</p>
		<h3> Deming</h3>
		<p> Have an aim and remember, the system determines performance.</p>

		<h3> A Common Strategy Theme</h3>
		<p> There's a common theme I can't shoehorn into each of the above—knowing what not to do and its close cousin, abandoning that which is not effective. Inertia is a hell of a thing though, and many people/orgs never pause to recognize what isn't effective. Especially when it comes to the abstract, like mindset, and ways of working. Like in life, it's always easier to not start smoking than it is to try to quit when you recognize it's harmful. Too many orgs are already smokers. Someone who can help them quit is worth their weight in gold.</p>

		<h3> How I've seen this play out</h3>
		<h4> Daimler Chrysler vs Ford </h4>
		<p> At the helm of Daimler Chrysler, CEO Jürgen Schrempp recognized that turning his company into a truly global automaker was table stakes for staying in business. Unfortunately, Schrempp's attempt to cobble together a global automaker was incoherent. Schrempp either didn't see, didn't acknowledge, or was unable to change the internal realities of the organizations he Frankensteined together and their inability to form a coherent whole. </p>
		<p>Schrempp failed the second part of Rumelt's basics on strategy, let Helmer down badly, and would have been scolded by Deming for nt recognizing that culture is a part of the system and that the dysfunctional culture at DCX was Schrempp's responsibility.</p>
		<p> Meanwhile, during the same time period at Ford, Alan Mulally spearheaded one of the finest corporate turnarounds of the modern era. I lived the DCX experience first hand. I read about Ford years later when <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13132620-american-icon">Bryce Hoffman</a> published his book and marveled at the contrast with DCX. Mulally had a crystal clear understanding of the challenge in front of him, understood that the limiting factor was Ford's culture, took responsibility for it, and molded the behemoth into a winner during the greatest economic disturbance since The Great Depression.</p>

		<h4> Logistix, a Mark Pettyjohn startup</h4>
		<p> The third party freight logistics (3PL) world is an inefficient wild west. Company A makes something and needs to ship it. It's not uncommon to have two or three intermediaries making that happen. It's largely done by phone or email. In other words, software hasn't yet eaten 3PL.</p>
		<p> In this chaos I saw a platform play to bring a two-sided marketplace to manufacturers and shippers.</p>
		<p> My mistakes were myriad. When the platform didn't pan out, I didn't know when to quit. I'm proud of how well the people in our org adapted. We became a tech-enabled broker, and ultimately had a modest exit. However, that tech afforded us no pricing power in a cutthroat market and a business with no pricing power is no business at all.</p>
		<p> In a room filled with Drucker, Helmer, Rumelt, Deming, and Porter, they all defer to Porter. Porter calmly repeats my paraphrase of his work back to him. Looking over his glasses and down the bridge of his nose he asks in a professorial tone <i>"Were you in a good market?"</i> No, I was not.</p>
