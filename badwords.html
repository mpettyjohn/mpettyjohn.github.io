		<h1>Bad Words: Misalignment in the Making</h1>

<h3> What is a bad word?</h3>

<p>They are words that are likely to be misunderstood or misinterpreted but they do so in a sneaky way so that the people using them don't realize misunderstanding is unfolding.</p>

<p>In organizations bad words create misalignment. Misalignment creates problems. Those problems compound.</p>

<p>People are really good at talking past one another. Bad words make it that much easier.</p>

<p>My idea of bad words isn’t the same as the "garbage language" corporate-speak Molly Young talks about <a href=https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/spread-of-corporate-speak.html/>here.</a> The bad words I'm describing are something else. They don't cause confusion because they're meaningless but because they have too many meanings and/or their meanings have been misunderstood.</p>

<p>I'm pushing two decades of experience now, a decent chunk of that time as a strategy consultant. That work has put me in rooms where I get to observe and listen. I've watched confusion, misalignment, and misinterpretations happen in real time. The wild thing isn't that this happens. It's how bad words give people the false sense that they are on the same page, when in reality they are walking away with different understandings.</p>

<h3> How do I know?</h3>

<p> There are clues in a discussion. They are just often missed. Active listening makes the brain work hard. <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6899290-your-brain-at-work/>David Rock</a> talks about it, as does <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference/>Chris Voss.</a> Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator tells his readers that negotiators work in teams for this exact reason. There's the person who is actively trying to negotiate and a second person whose sole job is to listen to what the primary negotiator might miss, which turns out to be quite a bit.</p>

<p> There's another simple way to know, ask. I’ve followed up enough times with a simple “hey, what does x mean?” to one participant. Then checked with another, and another to find that they’re all on different pages. Sometimes they’re not even in the same book.</p>

<h3> Defense Against</h3>
<p>Having someone who will speak up and ask “what does _______ mean?” even though it’s a basic question is valuable. Even more important is having a culture that at least doesn’t stifle this kind of questioning. It sounds basic. It feels basic typing it. It is basic! Yet I regularly see two things. Negative responses to alignment gambits like the "what does _______ mean?" while at the same time everyone from executives to individual contributors are using words in different ways. Problems cascade and confusion abounds when this happens.</p>

<p>That’s my idea of a bad word.</p>

<p>A few top offenders are:</p>
<ul>
<li> Communicate</li>
<p> "I communicated that via e-mail" or "I communicated that at the all-hands." I hear phrases like this a lot. This is not communication. This is sending an e-mail or making a statement. The missing principle is that communication belongs with the recipient(s) and what they take away.</p>
<p> There was one company I worked with that had an exec who was known for sending long-winded e-mails to the point that people would see his name and not even bother to open the e-mail. He was spending a lot of time and energy to communicate nothing.
<li> Strategy </li>
<p> It's hard to count all of the ways this word is misused. From referring to a tactic as strategy to talking about "strategic planning" to using the word without ever defining it, this word is rife for misunderstanding.</p>
<li> Empathy </li>
<p> Confusing empathy for sympathy is a top way this becomes a bad word. Then you have Paul Bloom who threw a landslide of mud into the water for this word with his book Against Empathy. Bloom focused on the "feeling what others feel and, in particular, feeling their pain" aspect of the word while mostly ignoring the other part, which is trying to understand someone's perspective. This word is a melting pot for misunderstanding.</p>
</ul>
