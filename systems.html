		<h1>Systems</h1>
		<p> You want to grow an org or even try to turn one around? You better understand the basics of systems.</p>
		<h3> "First, define it" - Max (a 6th grader)</h3>
		<p> "A system is a set of things, people, molecules, or whatever, interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time." - Donella Meadows <a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/"> Thinking In Systems</a></p>
		<p> Since we are talking about organizations, let's add something from Demingâ€”a system must have an aim. It sounds simple because it is. However, when I'm canvassing an organization and ask people, there is almost never a common aim. From SaaS to schools, I have found that an aligned organization is the exception. Instead tens, hundreds, or thousands of oars rowing in different directions is what I have seen as the norm.</p>
		<h3> What are the incentives?</h3> 
		<p>Remember, culture is a part of a system and incentives aren't just monetary. From Munger to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10278659-tell-me-how-you-measure-me-and-i-ll-tell-you">Goldrat</a> believe this, how you measure someone's performance will dictate their actions and behaviors.</p>
		<h3> Predictable Responses</h3>
		<p> While systems generate their own unique patterns of behavior, there are some predictable responses people will have within a system in response to pressure as well as demands for change. Understand these buckets of responses and you can foresee what someone is likely to do or why someone is doing something:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Distort the data (fudge the #'s)</li>
			<li>Distort the system (quick fixes vs root causes)</li>
			<li>Do nothing (Meadows call this "policy refusal")</li>
			<li>Improve the system (all too often not possible or too many roadblocks in someone's way to do this)</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Four options, only one is desirable and it comes with caveats.</p>

		<h3> Personal Algorithm</h3>
		<p> I've had good success understanding organizations with the following algorithm:</p>
		<p> Expectations + Incentives + Understanding (an individual has of their role/team/function/org) = Seeing and understanding the behaviors of the system and the people within it.</p>
